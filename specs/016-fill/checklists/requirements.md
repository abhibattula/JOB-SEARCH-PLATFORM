# Specification Quality Checklist: The Fill Release (016)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All 22 functional requirements trace to the approved design doc
  (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-27-feature-016-design.md`) and its three
  verified root-cause traces; the three plan-mode decisions (D1 apply-click,
  D2 fill-first, D3 on-page panel) were locked with the user on 2026-07-27,
  so no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were required.
- Surface names used in requirements (popup, panel, doctor, answer bank)
  are established product surfaces from features 010–015, not
  implementation details.
